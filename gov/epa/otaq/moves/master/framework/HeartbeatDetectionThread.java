/**
 * Detects work files that have been claimed by a distributed worker but haven't been processed
 * within a certain timeout period. Renames these files so that other distributed systems can
 * process them.<p>When a worker claims a file for processing, it renames the file with an
 * IN_PROGRESS status and periodically updates the file's last modified date. If the worker dies
 * or looses its network connection, it stops updating the file's date. The Heartbeat Detection
 * Thread checks the date on IN_PROGRESS files and renames them with a TO_DO status if the file
 * has not been updated for a length of time. If the worker re-starts or gets it connection back,
 * it will find that the files has been "reclaimed" by the Master.

	// worker is dead. Basically, if the worker hasn't updated its heartbeat file within the time limit,
	// the master will remove the heartbeat file and reclaim any in progress work. Because the heartbeat
	// file timestamp could be set by a different system with a different system clock (and/or timezone),
	// we can't rely on the actual timestamp. Instead, we compare to the last observed change in the
	// timestamp. Essentially, this means that if a worker is dead from the beginning, the master still
	// won't know until the full heartbeat timeout time duration has elapsed.
	//
	// MOVESMain.bat cleans out all heartbeat files when it starts, so in most use cases, there should be
	// no dead workers at the start. However, if MOVES is started from custom batch files or directly on 
	// the command line, old heartbeat files might still be in the SharedWork folder.
