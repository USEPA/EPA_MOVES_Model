# MOVES NEI Submissions QA Tool

The MOVES National Emission Inventory (NEI) Submissions Quality Assurance (QA) Tool includes scripts to run against onroad and nonroad county database (CDB) submissions for the NEI. The QA report generated by the QA Tool verifies that all table contents meet naming convention, format, data validity, and other checks. The report confirms that each CDB contains the appropriate tables and that the values within those tables are valid. It is very important that the QA Tool be properly run for each submitted CDB. 

The QA Tool is run in MOVES via the command line, using Ant, the MOVES dependency manager and command line interface tool. This document includes specific examples on how to do this. For general information on MOVES' command line tools, see [CommandLineMOVES.md](https://github.com/USEPA/EPA_MOVES_Model/blob/master/docs/CommandLineMOVES.md).

## Prerequisites

The QA Tool requires that the CDB has already been built using the MOVES County Data Manager and is ready to be checked. The tool *will not* aid in creating or populating an NEI CDB. The database must be loaded into MariaDB's data folder for the tool to find it.

### County Database Naming Convention

To keep track of the thousands of CDBs used in the NEI calculations, EPA has established a naming convention for CDBs that differentiate between databases and make automation of running and processing the inputs and outputs from MOVES easier. 

The naming convention for each CDB folder has 20 characters. The first 6 characters identify the county, the next 5 indicate the calendar year of the county database, and the last characters indicate the date on which the database was created. 

The first 6 characters consist of the letter `c` followed by the 5-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code for the county, including a leading zero when necessary. The next 5 characters are the letter `y`, followed by a 4-digit calendar year. This calendar year indicates the calendar year of the data contained in the database. A CDB can only contain data from a single calendar year. The last 8 digits, following an underscore character, represent the date on which the database was created in the `YYYYMMDD` format. 

An example of a CDB name is `c26161y2023_20240601` where this CDB names indicates `c26161` refers to the county FIPS code (in this case Washtenaw County, Michigan). `y2023` refers to the calendar year for the county database and `20240601` identifies the database modification date of June 1, 2024, in `YYYYMMDD` format. 

## Command Line Interface

To use MOVES' command line tools, first open the Windows command prompt and navigate to the MOVES directory. Then, run the command `setenv`. For more information on using MOVES' command line tools, see [CommandLineMOVES.md](https://github.com/USEPA/EPA_MOVES_Model/blob/master/docs/CommandLineMOVES.md).

The Ant command to run the NEI QA script is `onroadNEIQA`, and the Ant command to run the nonroad NEI QA script is `nonroadNEIQA`. Note that Ant commands are case sensitive. Inputs to these commands are specified by the following flags:

| Flag       | Behavior                                                     | Examples                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-Dinput`  | There are three types of input allowed:<br />1. A single input database<br />2. A comma-separated list of databases, wrapped in quotes<br />3. A .txt file with a list of databases, one on each line | 1.`-Dinput=c99001y2023_20240601`<br />2.`-Dinput="c99001y2023_20240601,c99002y2023_20240601"`<br />3.`-Dinput=db_list.txt` |
| `-Doutput` | A file to write the QA results to. Accepted formats are:<br />* `.xlsx` or `.xls` for spreadsheet output<br />* `.csv` for comma-separated output<br />* `.txt` or `.tab` for tab-separated output<br /><br />This input does not need to be wrapped in quotes unless there are spaces or commas in the filename. | 1. `-Doutput=QA_Report.xlsx`<br />2. `-Doutput="QA Report.csv"`<br />3. `-Doutput=QA_Report.txt` |

For input option #3 above, databases need to be separated by a new line. The following would be a valid `db_list.txt` file:

```
c99001y2023_20240601
c99002y2023_20240601
```

Putting everything together, the following are all valid ways of calling the QA scripts:

```batch
setenv
ant onroadNEIQA -Dinput=c99001y2023_20240601 -Doutput=QA_Report.xlsx
ant onroadNEIQA -Dinput="c99001y2023_20240601,c99002y2023_20240601" -Doutput=QA_Report.csv
ant onroadNEIQA -Dinput=db_list.txt -Doutput=QA_Report.txt
ant nonroadNEIQA -Dinput=c99001y2023_20240601 -Doutput=QA_Report.xlsx
ant nonroadNEIQA -Dinput="c99001y2023_20240601,c99002y2023_20240601" -Doutput=QA_Report.csv
ant nonroadNEIQA -Dinput=db_list.txt -Doutput="QA Report.txt"
```

## Output

The QA Tool saves its results to the specified output file. If multiple databases are run using the tool, they are all combined into one output file. These results are also saved in a database created by the tool called `All_CDB_Checks`. If the tool runs into a problem it can't resolve, it creates a table called `qa_checks_log`, so that users can tell how far the script got before the error occurred. There are a few additional tables that are only created if the tool detects overlaps and/or gaps in model year ranges in select tables, as described below.

### All_CDB_Checks
