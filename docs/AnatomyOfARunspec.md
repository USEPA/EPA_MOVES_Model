# Anatomy of a MOVES RunSpec

This document describes each element found in a MOVES run specification (RunSpec) and how it is used. It is intended to help users read and interpret a RunSpec file outside of the MOVES GUI. The MOVES GUI provides layers of error checking to prevent users from creating non-functional RunSpecs. The details of this error checking are outside the scope of this document. Therefore this document should not be seen as a guide for how to write a RunSpec by hand. 

MOVES RunSpecs are formatted as xml and follow standard xml conventions.  Each heading in the rest of the document refers to a specific xml element in a RunSpec. Subelements are noted with subheadings, with element and subelement names indicated in **bold text**. Likewise, element attributes are indicated in *italic text*. Each element contains example text from a MOVES RunSpec. For better readability, attribute values are presented in plaintext, but all attribute values should be enclosed in quotation marks (eg. `id="1"`) in a MOVES RunSpec.

## Description

```xml
<description><![CDATA[RunSpec description text goes here]]></description>
```

The description field is entered in the Description Panel of the MOVES GUI. The `<![CDATA[...]]>` is used to allow any character to be saved in this field.

## Models

```xml
<models>
    <model value="ONROAD"/>
</models>
```

The **models** element is a required element for a MOVES RunSpec. It has a single subelement of type **model**. The **model** subelement has only one attribute: *value*. 

Valid entries for *value* are:

* ONROAD - used to select an onroad model run
* NONROAD - used to select a nonroad model run

## Model scale

```xml
<modelscale value="Inv"/>
```

The **modelscale** element is a required element for a MOVES RunSpec. It has only one attribute: *value*. 

Valid entries for *value* attribute are:

* Inv - used to select inventory calculations and outputs from the MOVES run
* Rates - used to select rates calculations and outputs from the MOVES run

## Model domain

```xml
<modeldomain value="DEFAULT"/>
```

The **modeldomain** element is a required element for a MOVES RunSpec. It has only one attribute: *value*. 

Valid entries for *value* are:

* DEFAULT - used to select a Default Scale run. This is the only option for a Nonroad run.
* SINGLE - used to select a County Scale run
* PROJECT - used to select a Project Scale run

## Geographic selections

```xml
<geographicselections>
        <geographicselection type="COUNTY" key="8101" description="COLORADO - Pueblo County"/>
</geographicselections>
```

The **geographicselections** element is a required element for a MOVES RunSpec. It has a single type of subelement: **geographicselection**. For this element there are three attributes: *type*, *key*, and *description*. For an onroad Default Scale run, more than one **geographicselection** may be added, indicating that the MOVES run will include more than one county.

Valid entries for *type* are:

* COUNTY - this is the default value for most MOVES runs
* NATION - this value is selected in the GUI by choosing "Nation" in the "Advanced Features" Panel under "Region Aggregation"

The value entered for *key* should be the countyID (which is the same as a county's FIPS code) associated with the specified geographic selection in the county table in the MOVES database.  In the case where `type="NATION"`, the value for *key* should be "0".

The *description* attribute is a user aid and is not used by MOVES at runtime.

## Timespan

```xml
<timespan>
    <year key="2014"/>
    <month id="1"/>
    <day id="2"/>
    <day id="5"/>
    <beginhour id="1"/>
    <endhour id="24"/>
    <aggregateBy key="Hour"/>
</timespan>
```

The **timespan** element is a required element for a MOVES RunSpec. It defines the time spans(s) covered by the MOVES run. When running MOVES at Project Scale, only one year, month, day, hour combination can be covered by the RunSpec. The **timespan** element has seven subelements: **year**, **month**, **day**, **beginhour**, **endhour**, and **aggregateBy**.

### year

The **year** subelement indicates the calendar year for the model run. More than one calendar year can be chosen by including multiple **year** subelements. The **year** subelement has only one attribute: *key*. Entries for *key* are given as a four digit year.

### month

The **month** subelement indicates the month of the year for the model to run. More than one month can be selected by including multiple **month** subelements. Each month chosen will be run for each of the years defined in the RunSpec. The **month** subelement has only one attribute: *id*. Entries for *id* are given as a one or two digit month (eg. `id="2"`, or `id="12"`) and match the MOVES monthID, which starts at 1 for January and ends at 12 for December.

### day

The **day** subelement indicates the types of days for the model to run. Up to two **day** subelements can be included within **timespan**. Each type of day chosen will be run for every combination of year and month in the RunSpec. The **day** subelement has only one attribute: *id*.

Valid entries for *id* are:

* 2 - this indicates weekday days

* 5 - this indicates weekend days

### beginhour

The **beginhour** subelement indicates the first hour of the day to be included in the model run. Only one **beginhour** subelement can be included within **timespan**. The **beginhour** subelement has only one attribute: *id*. Entries for *id* are given as a one or two digit integer between 1 and 24  (eg. `id="14"`).  

### endhour

The **endhour** subelement indicates the last hour of the day to be included in the model run. Only one **endhour** subelement can be included within **timespan**. The **endhour** subelement has only one attribute: *id*. Entries for *id* are given as a one or two digit integer between 1 and 24 (eg. `id="14"`). 

### aggregateBy

The **aggregateBy** subelement indicates the degree of temporal pre-aggregation that should be done to the input data before the model runs. In the MOVES GUI this is selected in the "Time Aggregation" box of the "Advanced Features" Panel. The **aggregateBy** subelement has only one attribute: *key*. 

Valid entries for *key* are:

* Hour - This is the default value, and the only value available for a Nonroad or Rates mode run. 
* Day - Pre-aggregate inputs by day of the week
* Month - Pre-aggregate inputs by month of the year
* Year - Pre-aggregate inputs by calendar year

## Onroad vehicle selections

```xml
<onroadvehicleselections>
    <onroadvehicleselection fueltypeid="1" fueltypedesc="Gasoline" sourcetypeid="21" sourcetypename="Passenger Car"/>
    <onroadvehicleselection fueltypeid="2" fueltypedesc="Diesel Fuel" sourcetypeid="31" sourcetypename="Passenger Truck"/>
 </onroadvehicleselections>  
```

The **onroadvehicleselections** element selects the fuel type and source type combinations to be included in the MOVES run. This element and its subelements are only required for onroad MOVES runs. 

The **onroadvehicleselections** element has a single type of subelement: **onroadvehicleselection**. Many **onroadvehicleselection** subelements may be included in the RunSpec. For **onroadvehicleselection** there are four attributes that should be entered: *fueltypeid*, *fueltypedesc*, *sourcetypeid*, and *sourcetypename*.

Values for *fueltypeid* and *fueltypedesc* should be taken from the `fueltype` table in the MOVES default database. 

Values for *sourcetypeid* and *sourcetypename* should be taken from the `sourceusetype` table of the MOVES default database.

## Offroad vehicle selections

```xml
<offroadvehicleselections>
        <offroadvehicleselection fueltypeid="3" fueltypedesc="Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)" sectorid="2" sectorname="Construction"/>
        <offroadvehicleselection fueltypeid="3" fueltypedesc="Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)" sectorid="3" sectorname="Industrial"/>
</offroadvehicleselections>
```

The **offroadvehicleselections** element selects the fuel type and sector combinations to be included in the MOVES run. This element and its subelements are only required for nonroad MOVES runs. 

The **offroadvehicleselections** element has a single type of subelement: **offroadvehicleselection**. Many **offroadvehicleselection** subelements may be included in the RunSpec. For **offroadvehicleselection** there are four attributes that should be entered: *fueltypeid*, *fueltypedesc*, *sectorid*, and *sectorname*.

Values for *fueltypeid* and *fueltypedesc* should be taken from the `nrfueltype` table in the MOVES default database. 

Values for *sectorid* and *sectorname* should be taken from the `sector` table of the MOVES default database.

## Offroad vehicle sccs

```xml
<offroadvehiclesccs>
</offroadvehiclesccs>
```

The **offroadvehiclesccs** element is not necessary to complete a MOVES run and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Road types

```xml
<roadtypes>
        <roadtype roadtypeid="1" roadtypename="Off-Network" modelCombination="M1"/>
        <roadtype roadtypeid="2" roadtypename="Rural Restricted Access" modelCombination="M1"/>
        <roadtype roadtypeid="3" roadtypename="Rural Unrestricted Access" modelCombination="M1"/>
        <roadtype roadtypeid="4" roadtypename="Urban Restricted Access" modelCombination="M1"/>
        <roadtype roadtypeid="5" roadtypename="Urban Unrestricted Access" modelCombination="M1"/>
</roadtypes>
```

The **roadtypes** element is a required element for a MOVES RunSpec. It defines the road types to be included in the MOVES run. Each included roadtype is specified by a **roadtype** subelement with the attributes: *roadtypeid*, *roadtypename*, and *modelCombination*. When creating a MOVES onroad RunSpec at the national or County Scale all road types except for "Nonroad" should be included in the RunSpec. Likewise, when creating a MOVES nonroad RunSpec only the nonroad roadtype (roadtypeID 100) should be selected.

Values for *roadtypeid* and *roadtypename* should be taken from the `roadtype` table of the MOVES default database.

Valid entries for *modelCombination* are:

* M1 - this denotes an onroad run
* M2 -  this denotes a nonroad run

## Pollutant process associations

```xml
<pollutantprocessassociations>
    <pollutantprocessassociation pollutantkey="2" pollutantname="Carbon Monoxide (CO)" processkey="2" processname="Start Exhaust"/>
    <pollutantprocessassociation pollutantkey="3" pollutantname="Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)" processkey="1" processname="Running Exhaust"/>
</pollutantprocessassociations>
```

The **pollutantprocessassociations** element is is a required element for a MOVES RunSpec and is typically the largest part of a MOVES RunSpec. It details all of the combinations of pollutants and processes that should be included in the MOVES run. Many of these combinations have prerequisites that must also be included in this element. All of the pollutant and process combinations are enumerated in the `pollutantprocessassoc` table in the MOVES default database. More information on this table can be found in the [MOVES database documentation](MOVESDatabaseTables.md).

The  **pollutantprocessassociations** element is composed of **pollutantprocessassociation** subelements with the attributes: *pollutantkey*, *pollutantname*, *processkey*, and *processname*.

Values for *pollutantkey* and *pollutantname* should be taken from the `pollutant` table of the MOVES default database.

Values for *processkey* and *processname* should be taken from the `emissionprocess` table of the MOVES default database.

## Database selections

```xml
<databaseselections>
        <databaseselection servername="" databasename="db_for_input" description=""/>
</databaseselections>
```

This element is populated by the "Input Data Sets" box in the "Advanced Features" Panel of the MOVES GUI. This element is used to specify input databases created by MOVES tools (e.g., the "Build LEV Input Database" Tool), or to specify optional input databases for Default Scale or Nonroad runs. MOVES uses values from these input database tables instead of those in the MOVES default database. Zero or more **databaseselection** elements may be used, and the data will be imported in the order specified (i.e., if multiple databases have the same tables, and the tables have the same key entries, the values from the last database specified will be used in the MOVES run). If no input databases are to be used, this element may be omitted from the RunSpec. The **databaseselections** element may contain several **databaseselection** attributes: *servername*, *databasename*, and *description*.

The value entered for *servername* should be the address of the SQL server that hosts the selected database. MOVES defaults to the same server that contains the default database if this attribute is empty.

The value for *databasename* should be the schema name for the input database.

The value for *description* is not used at runtime, but is helpful for identifying the inputs used for the MOVES run.

## Internal control strategies

```xml
<internalcontrolstrategies>
</internalcontrolstrategies>
```

The **internalcontrolstrategies** element has been deprecated and may be omitted from the RunSpec.

## Input database

```xml
<inputdatabase servername="" databasename="" description=""/>
```

The element **inputdatabase** indicates the version of the default MOVES database to use. This element has three attributes: *servername*, *databasename*, and *description*. The default value for each of these attributes is an empty string. If this element is omitted, MOVES will use the default database specified in MOVESConfiguration.txt.

The value entered for *servername* should be the address of the SQL server that hosts the selected database. MOVES defaults to the same server that contains the default database if this attribute is empty.

The value for *databasename* should be the schema name for the input database.

The value for *description* is not used at runtime, but is helpful for identifying the inputs used for the MOVES run.

## Uncertainty parameters

```xml
<uncertaintyparameters uncertaintymodeenabled="false" numberofrunspersimulation="0" numberofsimulations="0"/>
```

The **uncertaintyparameters** element has been deprecated  and may be omitted from the RunSpec. 

## Geographic output detail

```xml
<geographicoutputdetail description="NATION"/>
```

The **geographicoutputdetail** element is set in the "Output Aggregation" box in the "Output Emissions Detail" Panel of the MOVES GUI. This element has one attribute: *description*.

Valid entries for *description* are:

* NATION - aggregate outputs over all geographical detail 
* STATE - aggregate outputs by state
* COUNTY - aggregate outputs by county
* ZONE - aggregate outputs by zone
* LINK - aggregate outputs by link (Project mode only)

## Output emissions breakdown selection

```xml
<outputemissionsbreakdownselection>
        <modelyear selected="false"/>
        <fueltype selected="false"/>
        <fuelsubtype selected="false"/>
        <emissionprocess selected="false"/>
        <onroadoffroad selected="false"/>
        <roadtype selected="false"/>
        <sourceusetype selected="false"/>
        <movesvehicletype selected="false"/>
        <onroadscc selected="false"/>
        <estimateuncertainty selected="false" numberOfIterations="2" keepSampledData="false" keepIterations="false"/>
        <sector selected="false"/>
        <engtechid selected="false"/>
        <hpclass selected="false"/>
        <regclassid selected="false"/>
</outputemissionsbreakdownselection>
```

The **outputemissionsbreakdownselection** element defines granularity of the MOVES run output. The **outputemissionsbreakdownselection** element has fourteen subelements: **modelyear**, **fueltype**, **fuelsubtype**, **emissionprocess**, **onroadoffroad**, **roadtype**, **sourceusetype**, **movesvehicletype**, **onroadscc**, **estimateduncertainty**, **sector**, **engtechid**, **hpclass**, and **aggregateBy**. These elements are summarized below, for brevity. All of these elements can be toggled by setting the *selected* attribute to "true". MOVES defaults to having none of the options selected if this element is omitted from the RunSpec.

| subelement               | description                                                                                                                     |

## Output database

```xml
<outputdatabase servername="" databasename="demo_county_inv_mo" description=""/>
```

The element **outputdatabase** is a required element for a MOVES RunSpec. It identifies the database to store the MOVES output in. it contains the attributes: *servername*, *databasename*, and *description*.

The value entered for *servername* should be the address of the SQL server that hosts the selected database. MOVES defaults to the same server that contains the default database if this attribute is empty.

The value for *databasename* should be the schema name for the input database.

The value for *description* is not used at runtime, but is helpful for identifying the inputs used for the MOVES run.

## Output time step

```xml
<outputtimestep value="Hour"/>
```

The element **outputtimestep** is a required element for a MOVES RunSpec. This element sets the degree of temporal aggregation of the model output.  The **outputtimestep** element has only one attribute: *value*. 

Valid entries for *value* are:

* Hour - results are not aggregated and are reported for each hour in the RunSpec
* 24-Hour Day - aggregate results over a full 24-hour day for a typical weekend day (dayID 2) or weekday day (dayID 5)
* Portion of Week - aggregate results by weekday and weekend portions of the week. Specifically, results for dayID 2 will be emissions for a typical 2-day weekend and results for dayID 5 will be emissions for a typical 5-day work week. This is equivalent to selecting 24-Hour Day and multiplying the weekend day results by 2 and the weekday day results by 5.
* Month - aggregate by month
* Year - aggregate by calendar year

## Output vmt data

```xml
<outputvmtdata value="false"/>
```

If set to true, include vehicle miles traveled (VMT) activity in the output database if calculated during the MOVES run. It can only be set to "true" for onroad runs. This element is not necessary to complete a MOVES run and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Output sho

```xml
<outputsho value="false"/>
```

If set to true, include source hours operating (SHO) activity in the output database if calculated during the MOVES run. It can only be set to "true" for onroad runs. This element is not necessary to complete a MOVES run and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Output sh

```xml
<outputsh value="false"/>
```

If set to true, include source hours (SH) activity in the output database if calculated during the MOVES run. It can only be set to "true" for onroad runs. This element is not necessary to complete a MOVES run and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Output shp

```xml
<outputshp value="false"/>
```

If set to true, include source hours parked (SHP) activity in the output database if calculated during the MOVES run. It can only be set to "true" for onroad runs. This element is not necessary to complete a MOVES run and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Output shidling

```xml
<outputshidling value="false"/>
```

If set to true, include source hours idling (shidling) activity in the output database if calculated during the MOVES run. It can only be set to "true" for onroad runs. This element is not necessary to complete a MOVES run and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Output starts

```xml
<outputstarts value="false"/>
```

If set to true, include starts activity in the output database if calculated during the MOVES run. It can only be set to "true" for onroad runs. This element is not necessary to complete a MOVES run and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Output population

```xml
<outputpopulation value="false"/>
```

If set to true, include vehicle population counts in the output database if calculated during the MOVES run. It can only be set to "true" for onroad runs. This element is not necessary to complete a MOVES run and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Scale input database

```xml
<scaleinputdatabase servername="localhost" databasename="cdb_pueblo_mi" description=""/>
```

This selects the input database used by Project and County Scale runs. This element only needs to be included for MOVES runs at County Scale or Project Scale and is not used for Default Scale or Nonroad runs.

## PM size

```xml
<pmsize value="0"/>
```

This element is deprecated. This element may be omitted from a RunSpec, or *value* must be set to 0 otherwise. 

## Output factors

```xml
<outputfactors>
    <timefactors selected="true" units="Portions of Week"/>
    <distancefactors selected="true" units="Miles"/>
    <massfactors selected="true" units="Grams" energyunits="Joules"/>
</outputfactors>
```

The **outputfactors** element sets the units presented in the model output. This element has three subelements: **timefactors**, **distancefactors**, **massfactors**. These subelements are summarized below:

### timefactors

The **timefactors** element indicates the output time units. and should match the setting in **outputtimestep**. The *selected* parameter should always equal `true.`

Valid entries for the *units* parameter are:

* Hours - matching **outputtimestep** *value*: Hour
* Days - matching **outputtimestep** *value*: 24-Hour Day
* Portions of Week - matching **outputtimestep** *value*: Portion of Week
* Month - matching **outputtimestep** *value*: Month
* Years - matching **outputtimestep** *value*: Year

### distancefactors

The **distancefactors** element indicates the output distance units. The *selected* parameter should always equal `true.`

Valid entries for the *units* parameter are:

* Miles - output distance values in miles
* Kilometers - output distance values in kilometers

### massfactors

 The **massfactors** element indicates both the output mass and energy units. The *selected* parameter should always equal `true.`

Valid entries for the *units* parameter are:

* Grams - output mass values in grams
* Kilograms - output mass values in kilograms
* Pounds - output mass values in pounds
* U.S. Ton - output mass values in U.S. tons

Valid entries for the *energyunits* parameter are:

* Joules - output energy values in joules
* KiloJoules - output energy values in kilojoules
* Million BTU - output energy values in million British Thermal Units BTUs.

## Save data

```xml
<savedata>
</savedata>
```

The **savedata** element was intended to be an advanced performance feature available to speed up batch runs by allowing users to save intermediate output from one run and to reuse it for another run with identical activity or other characteristics. Checking the "Save Data" boxes in the "Masterloopable Components" box of the "Advanced Features" Panel of the MOVES GUI adds **class** subelements to **savedata**.

Valid *name* parameters for these **class** subelements are:

* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.framework.EmissionCalculator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.general.MeteorologyGenerator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.AverageSpeedOperatingModeDistributionGenerator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.EvaporativeEmissionsOperatingModeDistributionGenerator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.FuelEffectsGenerator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.internalcontrolstrategies.onroadretrofit.OnRoadRetrofitStrategy
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.internalcontrolstrategies.rateofprogress.RateOfProgressStrategy
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.LinkOperatingModeDistributionGenerator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.MesoscaleLookupOperatingModeDistributionGenerator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.ProjectTAG
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.RatesOperatingModeDistributionGenerator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.SourceBinDistributionGenerator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.StartOperatingModeDistributionGenerator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.TankFuelGenerator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.TankTemperatureGenerator
* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.implementation.ghg.TotalActivityGenerator

When one or more of these options are selected, the **generatordatabase** tag should be utilized to specify where these data should be saved.

In a subsequent run, the modeler may choose to not execute the associated component (see the **donotexecute** element), and instead input the saved data using the "Input Data Sets" function of the Advanced Features panel (see the **databaseselection** element). This choice is only appropriate if the saved data and the data that would have been generated are the same.

However, these features were not updated or tested prior with the latest model release.  Some of the listed components are no longer used as of MOVES3.  Rather than using this feature to improve performance, we recommend using the strategies described [Tips For Faster MOVES Runs](TipsForFasterMOVESRuns.md).

As such, this element is typically empty in a RunSpec, is not necessary to complete a MOVES run, and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Do not execute

```xml
<donotexecute>
</donotexecute>
```

The **donotexecute** element was intended to be an advanced performance feature available to speed up batch runs by allowing users to save intermediate output from one run and to reuse it for another run with identical activity or other characteristics. Checking the "Don't Execute" boxes in the "Masterloopable Components" box of the "Advanced Features" Panel of the MOVES GUI, adds **class** subelements to **donotexecute**.

Valid *name* parameters for these subelements are:

* gov.epa.otaq.moves.master.framework.EmissionCalculator

In some runs, the modeler may choose to save the results of specific components (see the **savedata** element). In subsequent runs, those components can be skipped by specifying them using the **donotexecute** element, and instead input the saved data using the "Input Data Sets" function of the Advanced Features panel (see the **databaseselection** element). This choice is only appropriate if the saved data and the data that would have been generated are the same.

However, these features were not updated and not tested prior with the latest model release.  Some of the listed components are no longer used as of MOVES3.  Rather than using this feature to improve performance, we recommend using the strategies described [Tips For Faster MOVES Runs](TipsForFasterMOVESRuns.md).

As such, this element is typically empty in a RunSpec, is not necessary to complete a MOVES run, and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Generatordatabase

```xml
<generatordatabase shouldsave="false" servername="" databasename="" description=""/>
```

The **generatordatabase** element specifies the database to save the outputs selected in the **savedata** element. Specifically, if the **savedata** element is used, the *shouldsave* attribute should be set to "true", and a database name should be given in the *databasename* attribute to specify where to save the data.

This element is not necessary to complete a MOVES run and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Donotperformfinalaggregation

```xml
<donotperformfinalaggregation selected="false"/>
```

This element can be used for debugging purposes. It is only meaningful for inventory mode runs (see **modelscale** element). If *selected* is set to "true", the unaggregated outputs from each bundle will be saved to the output database. It may result in rows with duplicate ID fields that MOVES would have normally summed together during final aggregation. This element is not necessary to complete a MOVES run and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Lookuptableflags

```xml
<lookuptableflags scenarioid="" truncateoutput="true" truncateactivity="true" truncatebaserates="true"/>
```

This element is used for rates mode runs (see **modelscale** element). 

The value saved in the *scenarioid* attribute should not be blank in a rates mode run. It gets saved directly in the rates output tables as the MOVESScenarioID column, which can be used as a granular method to differentiate rates from different scenarios. This field has a 40-character limit.

The other attributes on this element instruct MOVES to delete interim data from various output database tables. These output tables are not intended to be used for rates mode output, so clearing the tables makes the output smaller:

* *truncateoutput* instructs MOVES to clear the MOVESOutput table after rate calculations
* *truncateactivity* instructs MOVES to clear the MOVESActivityOutput table after rate calculations
* *truncatebaserates* instructs MOVES to clear the BaseRateOutput table after rate calculations

This element is not necessary for inventory mode runs and may be omitted from a RunSpec.

## Skipdomaindatabasevalidation

```xml
<skipdomaindatabasevalidation selected="false"/>
```

This element can be used for debugging purposes. If *selected* is set to "true", MOVES will skip the domain database validation step, allowing the model to be run without getting a green check on the Create Input Database Panel in the GUI. Caution: bypassing domain database validation can easily lead to invalid results. Do not use this setting for SIP or conformity analyses.

This element is not necessary to complete a MOVES run and may be omitted from a RunSpec.
